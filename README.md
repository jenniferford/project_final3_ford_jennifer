###[JQuery Plugin:FlexNav](http://jasonweaver.name/lab/flexiblenavigation/) I used this plugin to create a sticky navigation that also changes to a mobile friendly drop navigation

###[JQuery Plugin:backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/) I used this plugin to create a more responsive background image, rather than tiling it and to change the background from side to side with a slideshow animation

###[JQuery Plugin:unslider](http://unslider.com/) I used this plugin to create slideshows for my menu items to be displayed in
